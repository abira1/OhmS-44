## Test Cases

### Functional Tests

#### Basic Pull-to-Refresh
- [ ] Pull down from top of page triggers refresh
- [ ] Pull distance threshold (80px) correctly triggers refresh
- [ ] Visual indicator appears during pull gesture
- [ ] Haptic feedback triggers at threshold
- [ ] Content refreshes successfully
- [ ] Loading state displays correctly
- [ ] Success/error states handled properly

#### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Pull indicator appears smoothly
- [ ] Progress bar updates in real-time
- [ ] Icon rotates based on pull distance
- [ ] Color changes when threshold reached
- [ ] Retro scanlines animation works
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states

#### Gesture Recognition
- [ ] Only triggers when at top of page (scrollY ≤ 5px)
- [ ] Ignores horizontal swipes
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with existing swipe navigation
- [ ] Works with single finger touch
- [ ] Ignores multi-touch gestures
- [ ] Handles rapid gesture changes

#### Device Compatibility
- [ ] Touch devices: Full pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Non-touch devices: Fallback refresh button appears
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+R) works on desktop
- [ ] Capacitor haptics work in native app
- [ ] Web vibration API works in browsers

### Performance Tests

#### Smooth Animations
- [ ] 60fps during pull gesture
- [ ] No frame drops during animation
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Efficient memory usage
- [ ] No memory leaks during repeated use

#### Touch Responsiveness
- [ ] Immediate response to touch start
- [ ] Real-time pull distance tracking
- [ ] No input lag or delays
- [ ] Accurate gesture recognition
- [ ] Proper event cleanup

### Edge Cases

#### Network Scenarios
- [ ] Slow network: Extended loading states
- [ ] Failed refresh: Error handling and retry
- [ ] Offline mode: Appropriate messaging
- [ ] Network recovery: Automatic retry

#### User Interactions
- [ ] Rapid pull gestures
- [ ] Interrupted gestures (finger lift mid-pull)
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous touches
- [ ] Pull while already refreshing
- [ ] Pull during page scroll

#### Browser Edge Cases
- [ ] Browser zoom levels (50%-200%)
- [ ] Landscape/portrait orientation changes
- [ ] Browser refresh during pull gesture
- [ ] Tab switching during refresh
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation

## Testing Tools and Methods

### Manual Testing
1. **Device Testing Lab**
   - Physical devices for each category
   - BrowserStack for cross-browser testing
   - Chrome DevTools device emulation

2. **Network Simulation**
   - Chrome DevTools network throttling
   - Proxy tools for connection simulation
   - Offline testing with service worker

### Automated Testing
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Hook functionality (`usePullToRefresh`)
   - Device capability detection
   - Haptic feedback integration

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Component interaction testing
   - State management verification
   - Event handling validation

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Playwright for cross-browser testing
   - Touch gesture simulation
   - Visual regression testing

### Performance Testing
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Chrome DevTools Performance tab
   - React DevTools Profiler
   - Lighthouse performance audits

2. **Memory Testing**
   - Memory leak detection
   - Garbage collection monitoring
   - Long-running session testing

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time User
1. User opens app on mobile device
2. Scrolls to top of content
3. Attempts pull-to-refresh gesture
4. Observes visual feedback and haptic response
5. Completes refresh action
6. Verifies content updates

### Scenario 2: Desktop Fallback
1. User opens app on desktop browser
2. Observes refresh button in top-right corner
3. Clicks refresh button
4. Uses Ctrl+R keyboard shortcut
5. Verifies both methods work correctly

### Scenario 3: Poor Network Conditions
1. User on slow 3G connection
2. Initiates pull-to-refresh
3. Observes extended loading state
4. Network fails during refresh
5. Error handling displays appropriately
6. Retry mechanism works correctly

### Scenario 4: Rapid Gestures
1. User performs multiple rapid pull gestures
2. System handles overlapping gestures gracefully
3. No performance degradation
4. Proper state management maintained
