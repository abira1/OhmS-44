# Firebase Database Rules Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide provides secure and user-friendly Firebase Realtime Database rules for the OhmS project with notice interactions (likes and comments).

## 🔒 Security Features

### ✅ **User-Friendly Security**
- **Authenticated access**: All users must be signed in to read data
- **Self-management**: Users can only edit their own profiles and interactions
- **Admin control**: Admin email has full access for moderation
- **Data validation**: Ensures data integrity and prevents malicious input
- **Content limits**: Comments limited to 1000 characters

### ✅ **Permission Structure**
- **Read access**: All authenticated users can read all data
- **Write access**: Restricted based on data type and user role
- **User profiles**: Users can create/update their own profiles
- **Notice interactions**: Users can like and comment on notices
- **Admin functions**: Only admin can create/edit notices and moderate content

## 📋 **Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Choose Your Rules Version

#### **Option A: Full Security Rules** (Recommended for Production)
Use `firebase-database-rules.json` - includes comprehensive validation and security

#### **Option B: Simplified Rules** (Good for Testing)
Use `firebase-rules-simplified.json` - easier to implement, still secure

### Step 2: Apply Rules to Firebase

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)

   - Paste into the Firebase rules editor
   - Click "Publish" to save

### Step 3: Test the Implementation

1. **Refresh your OhmS app**
2. **Test notice interactions**:
   - Expand a notice
   - Click like button
   - Add a comment
   - Verify real-time updates

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Still Getting Permission Errors
**Solution**:
